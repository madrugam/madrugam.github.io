      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a philosopher who is interested in ethics, philosophy of law, philosophy of education, philosophy of artificial intelligence, and Chinese philosophy. I approach philosophy as a broadly dialogical practice—one that treats argument, interpretation, and inquiry as shared intellectual activities rather than adversarial exercises. Across both research and teaching, I am interested in how normative reasoning operates within institutions, and in how moral responsibility is shaped by epistemic risk, uncertainty, and power.

My research in philosophy of law focuses on punishment, moral responsibility, and the ethical significance of uncertainty in legal and institutional decision-making. I am particularly interested in questions about when the imposition of risk is morally permissible, how evidentiary standards shape responsibility, and how punishment can be justified under conditions of imperfect knowledge. These concerns also inform my work in applied ethics and political philosophy, especially where legal norms intersect with emerging technologies.

I also work in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, where I examine issues of responsibility, authority, bias, and justification in algorithmic and automated decision-making systems used in domains such as criminal justice, education, and public governance. Rather than treating AI ethics as a purely technical problem, I approach it as a normative and institutional question about how reasons, decisions, and accountability are distributed.

My work in philosophy of education and Chinese philosophy informs both my research and pedagogy. Engagement with early Confucian and Daoist thought has shaped my understanding of moral cultivation, relational agency, and the role of dialogue in ethical life, while my work in philosophy of education emphasizes teaching as a practice aimed at cultivating intellectual agency: the ability to reason carefully, articulate commitments clearly, and revise one’s views in light of argument and evidence.

Across these areas, my work is unified by a central question: how should we reason, and teach others to reason, under conditions of disagreement, uncertainty, and institutional constraint?

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        My research centers on punishment, moral responsibility, and the ethics of epistemic risk, especially in legal and institutional
        decision-making. I work primarily in philosophy of law, applied ethics, philosophy of education, and political philosophy, with additional research on
        artificial intelligence and algorithmic governance. I am particularly interested in how uncertainty, evidence, and risk assessment shape the moral justification of punishment and
        sentencing, as well as how emerging technologies complicate traditional accounts of responsibility and authority.

      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        My approach to teaching philosophy is grounded in the conviction that philosophical education is not primarily the transmission of doctrines, but the cultivation of intellectual agency. To study philosophy is to learn how to reason carefully under conditions of uncertainty, disagreement, and incomplete information—conditions that characterize not only academic inquiry, but civic life, professional decision-making, and everyday moral judgment. My teaching therefore emphasizes philosophy as a dialogical practice: one that develops students’ ability to articulate reasons, assess evidence, engage disagreement respectfully, and revise their views in light of argument.

This pedagogical orientation shapes both the content and structure of my courses. Across classes in critical thinking, logic, ethics, philosophy of law, philosophy of technology, and contemporary moral problems, I organize material around central questions rather than isolated theories. Students are invited to ask not only what a philosopher argues, but why those arguments matter, how they function, and where they succeed or fail when applied to real institutional contexts such as law, education, or emerging technologies. This approach helps students see philosophy as a living practice with stakes, rather than as a collection of historical positions to be memorized.

Because many of my students are first-generation college students, working students, or students returning to education after time away, I design my courses to be both intellectually rigorous and structurally transparent. I use clear learning objectives, scaffolded assignments, and explicit grading rubrics so that expectations are visible rather than implicit. Low-stakes writing, structured discussion prompts, and iterative feedback allow students to practice philosophical skills—argument reconstruction, conceptual analysis, and critical evaluation—before being assessed at a higher level. This scaffolding is not remedial; it is a principled response to the fact that philosophical reasoning is a learned skill, not merely a natural aptitude.
